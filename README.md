# An analysis on Spotify Tracks
An analysis on a dataset of 160k spotify tracks from 1921-2020. Done as part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree, project 1.

## Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

## Motivation
Music is a big part of many people's lives, mine included. I love listening to songs, and I enjoy the various feelings I get from them.
I'm also a huge fan of the artist Adele, and I've been listening soulfully to her heart-wrenching songs since 2013.

With these 2 goals in mind, I decided to analyze the dataset and find the answers to the following questions:

1. Are there any notable trends in recent years' popular songs? 

2. Based on the dataset, how well is Adele doing compared to other singers in 2020?

3. What are the key differences between Adele and her top competitors?

## Libraries
```
1. Pandas 
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
```
Specific version can be found on requirements.txt
